### The Philosophy of Digital Gardens

_NOTE: This section is largely taken from [**Anne-Laure Le Cunff**](https://www.mentalnodes.com/about) and her website [MentalNodes.com](https://www.mentalnodes.com/)_

Digital Gardens solve two problems:

1. Our ability to **COMMUNICATE** and **SHARE** on the internet in novel, positive ways.
2. Our ability to **COMPRHEND** and **SYNTHESIZE** information with emphasis on **CREATIVITY** rather than **CONSUMPTION**.

[[Lavoisier once said: “Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme” --- meaning: <br>“Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.”::lmn]] There are three simple rules to go from collector to creator:

- **Collect**. Note-taking, raw snippets, Kindle highlights + personal commentary.
- **Connect**. Link to previous notes. Do not keep orphan notes.
- **Create**. Write original article.

[[Many note-takers hoard content because it gives them an illusion of knowledge. <br><br>The best way to truly understand anything is to use the generation effect: to produce your own content, in your own words, and to share it with the world to create a feedback loop.::rmn]] The only way to learn in public is to **build** in public.

Linear thinking is a ultimately a myth. Thinking is not only non-linear, it's messy. It involves a lot of back and forth, dead ends, branching, walking back, merging ideas, changing ideas, contradicting ideas. [[Our natural fear of being judged leads most people to build, learn, and think privately. But seeking validation should not be the goal of learning in public. <br><br>Instead, the goal should be to tap into your network's collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops.::lmn]]

Hence why you do not keep orphan notes: Every time you write a new note, make sure to go back to previous notes and to interlink them together. Orphan notes do not contribute to the serendipitous creation of new insights. Only by connecting notes together can we go from collector to creator
