## Learn More
This platform is a delivery and engagement solution, which is the primary channel by which our publishing service delivers content to subscribers and viewers. The service is primarily geared towards newspapers, magazines, blogs, books, and scholarly journals. The platform allows for each to be organized in a manner that is fit for its intended delivery method. Our solution can scale to large organizations, but it is also suitable for small business, consisting of as little as one member.
